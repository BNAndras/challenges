# PyBites Blog Code Challenges

> The best way to learn to code is by doing it. PyBites Code Challenges == accelerated learning, but also fun and collaboration endorsing.

Welcome to the PyBites Blog Challenges page. (Please note, these are not the same as our [Bites of Py Exercises](https://codechalleng.es/bites/)) 

These are free form, open ended, mini coding projects designed to take anywhere from a day to a week, created for our wonderful PyBites Community. 

Q: How do I get started?
A: Head over to [our platform](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/), click on one and follow the instructions. 

Q: Where can I see other people's code submissions?
A: Browse (or checkout) [our community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community) - all PRs get merged into that branch.

Q: How do I join your Slack Community?
A: Use [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/pybites/shared_invite/enQtNDAxODc0MjEyODM2LTNiZjljNTI2NGJiNWI0MTRkNjY4YzQ1ZWU4MmQzNWQyN2Q4ZTQzMTk0NzkyZTRmMThlNmQzYTk5Y2Y5ZDM4NDU) - and use #codechallenges for coding questions.

Q: Can I help you out with code reviewing?
A: We are still getting a pretty manageable number of PRs to be able to merge them all in ourselves, but we do want to give each PR a bit more of a code review. As we're pretty busy we want to turn this into a *community effort*. So if you want to help out merging PRs into our challenges branch, become a moderator (and mentor!), you can volunteer [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pybites/shared_invite/enQtNDAxODc0MjEyODM2LTNiZjljNTI2NGJiNWI0MTRkNjY4YzQ1ZWU4MmQzNWQyN2Q4ZTQzMTk0NzkyZTRmMThlNmQzYTk5Y2Y5ZDM4NDU).

Q: Is this a place where we gonna be cool... just like Fonzie?
A: Ah you mean something like a _Code of conduct_? We wrote this when we started 2 years ago and it still holds true: "Remember, we don't strive for the 'best' solution, it's not a competition! Learning more + better Python is the main objective. Respect the newbie. There is no right or wrong answer. Do as much or as little as you want. Just have fun!"

Q: I don't see the tests?
A: Remember our blog code challenges are mostly open-ended and for you to work locally using Git, then submit (PR) your code back to the repo's community branch. Do you like a more test-driven approach where you run your code against a set of `pytest`s in the comfort of your browser? In that case we highly recommend that you try out our growing collection (173 at the time of writing) of [Bites of Py Exercises](https://codechalleng.es/bites/) ...

We believe solving code challenges is a very effective way to achieve Python mastery. Code more Python, share your journey on Slack, good luck and have fun!

	Keep Calm and Code in Python!
